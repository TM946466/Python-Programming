This program takes space seperated infix equations and converts them into postfix form.


File Entry:

The application will take a file name through the command line if it is given one. 
The file given must not have equations seperated by blank lines or it will
run the first results for the first line of the file and then revert to its Open Ended Entry format.

Open Ended Entry:

If no file name is given through the command line the program will operate in its Open Ended Entry format.
In this format space seperated infix equations can be fed directly to the application by a user,
The user wil be prompted to enter an infix equation and upon entry will be given the equation 
in its post fix form followed by the integer solution to the equation.
